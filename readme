--- Installation ---

Make sure you have a PS3 model with SACD compatible player. For more information
on what model specifically go to: http://ps3sacd.com/faq.html#_Toc180147566

You need to install a custom firmware to be able to rip SACDs. At this time of
writing the PS3 firmware has not been cracked for firmware 3.56 and upwards. So
in order to install the correct firmware you'll have to make sure your firmware
is lower or equal to 3.55. A downgrade for a firmware higher than 3.55 is NOT
available.

The custom firmware that is needed must be 3.55 and should incorporate the ever
so important LV1 patch to allow access to the System Manager services of GameOS.
A firmware which incorporates that is the OtherOS++ firmware. More information
and download links can be found here: http://gitbrew.org/otheros/

Custom Firmware installation steps:

  1: Plug a USB stick into your computer
  2: Create a folder in the root of the USB stick called PS3
  3: Create a folder inside the PS3 folder called UPDATE
  4: Download the 3.55 OtherOS++ firmware (http://gitbrew.org/otheros/)
  5: Move PS3UPDAT.PUP to the directory UPDATE that you just created on the USB
     stick
  6: Plug the USB stick into your PS3
  7: Navigate to Settings Tab
  8: Choose System Update
  9: Choose Update via Storage Media
 10: It will say it found Version 3.55
 11: Choose OK
 12: Accept Conditions and Follow the instructions
 
If the steps above did not work for you, then you are probably on 3.55 already.
You will have to do a recovery menu mode installation:

  1: Plug a USB stick into your computer
  2: Create a folder in the root of the USB stick called PS3
  3: Create a folder inside the PS3 folder called UPDATE
  4: Download the 3.55 OtherOS++ firmware (http://gitbrew.org/otheros/)
  5: Move PS3UPDAT.PUP to the directory UPDATE that you just created on the USB
     stick
  6: Plug the USB stick into your PS3
  7: Power down the PS3 through the menu
  8: Now press and HOLD the power button, the system will startup and shutdown
     again
  9: Release the power button, then press & HOLD power again, you'll hear one
     beep
     followed by two consecutive beeps
 10: Release power then follow the on-screen instructions. You're now in the
     recovery menu
 11: Connect the USB device and select "System Update."
 12: Accept Conditions and Follow the instructions

-- Installation Instructions --

Now you've completed the OtherOS firmware upgrade you are ready to install
sacd-ripper.pkg.

In order for the PS3 BluRay player to authenticate the SACD disc and to decode
DST to DSD two SPU isoself modules will be extracted from the system. In order
to do so you must give the SACD-Ripper the PS3 keys so it can extract them
automatically.

Get the PS3 keys from http://git-hacks.com/ps3free/ps3keys and put these in the
root of an USB disc. They will be asked for during first time installation,
after that you can remove the keys from your USB disc.

-- Build Instructions --

To compile you will need the psl1ght suite. If you want to compile on a windows
environment I advice you to follow the CygWin installation as the MingW
installation is unstable.

When psl1ght has been properly setup you need to configure SACD-Ripper with the
following commands:

  1. svn checkout http://sacd-ripper.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sacd-ripper
  2. cd sacd-ripper
  3. sh configure
  4. make

SACD-Ripper should compile without errors and warnings. Once completed you 
should have the sacd-ripper.pkg package that can be installed on your PS3.

To compile the Windows scarletbook tool:
  1. Open the Visual Studio Command prompt
  2. Change directory to libs\libiconv
  3. run: "nmake -f Makefile.msvc NO_NLS=1"
  4. now you can compile using the MSVC project file
  
-- Information --

SACD-Ripper supports the following output formats:

 - 2ch DSDIFF (DSD)
 - 2ch DSDIFF (DST) (if already DST encoded)
 - 2ch DSF (DSD)
 - mch DSDIFF (DSD)
 - mch DSDIFF (DST)
 - mch DSF (DSD)
 - ISO (due to the 4GB FAT32 size limit on the PS3, files will be splitted when
   larger)

At this time of writing both Saracon and Audiogate do not support DST encoded
files. Audiogate only supports 2ch files and Saracon does not support DSF
files. Please keep that in mind before selecting your file output.

There seems to be a SACD BluRay read speed limit that sets the maximum read
speed to 2.6MB/sec, yes I agree, this is slow! But DST decoding is even
slower.. The PS3 GameOS has 6 SPUs available for user operations. SACD-Ripper
uses 1 SPU for decryption and the other 5!! for DST decoding. Although this
process is quite optimal the current decoding speed has been measured to
be 0.9MB/sec for a 2 channel rip. So for 2ch DST tracks the write speed to disc
will be around 2.3MB/sec, for a multi-channel the write speed is a bit higher
at 2.4MB.sec but decoding is even slower at 0.6MB/sec.

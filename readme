Make sure you have a PS3 model with SACD compatible player. For more information
on what model specifically go to: http://ps3sacd.com/faq.html#_Toc180147566

You need to install a custom firmware to be able to rip SACDs. At this time of
writing the PS3 firmware has not been cracked for firmware 3.56 and upwards. So
in order to install the correct firmware you'll have to make sure your firmware
is lower or equal to 3.55. A downgrade for a firmware higher than 3.55 is NOT
available.

The custom firmware that is needed must be 3.55 and should incorporate the ever 
so important LV1 patch to allow access to the System Manager services of GameOS. 
A firmware which incorporates that is the OtherOS++ firmware. More information 
and download links can be found here: http://gitbrew.org/otheros/

Custom Firmware installation steps:

  1: Plug a USB stick into your computer
  2: Create a folder in the root of the USB stick called PS3
  3: Create a folder inside the PS3 folder called UPDATE
  4: Download the 3.55 OtherOS++ firmware (http://gitbrew.org/otheros/)
  5: Move PS3UPDAT.PUP to the directory UPDATE that you just created on the USB
     stick
  6: Plug the USB stick into your PS3
  7: Navigate to Settings Tab
  8: Choose System Update
  9: Choose Update via Storage Media
 10: It will say it found Version 3.55
 11: Choose OK
 12: Accept Conditions and Follow the instructions
   
If the steps above did not work for you, then you are probably on 3.55 already.
You will have to do a recovery menu mode installation:

  1: Plug a USB stick into your computer
  2: Create a folder in the root of the USB stick called PS3
  3: Create a folder inside the PS3 folder called UPDATE
  4: Download the 3.55 OtherOS++ firmware (http://gitbrew.org/otheros/)
  5: Move PS3UPDAT.PUP to the directory UPDATE that you just created on the USB
     stick
  6: Plug the USB stick into your PS3
  7: Power down the PS3 through the menu
  8: Now press and HOLD the power button, the system will startup and shutdown
     again
  9: Release the power button, then press & HOLD power again, youll hear one
     beep
     followed by two consecutive beeps
 10: Release power then follow the on-screen instructions. Youre now in the
     recovery menu
 11: Connect the USB device and select "System Update."
 12: Accept Conditions and Follow the instructions

Installation Instructions

Now you've completed the OtherOS firmware upgrade you are ready to install sacd-ripper.pkg.

In order for the PS3 BluRay player to authenticate SACD disc and to decode DST to DSD
two SPU isoself modules will be extracted from the system. In order to do so you must 
give the SACD-Ripper the PS3 keys so it can extract them automatically.

Get the PS3 keys from http://git-hacks.com/ps3free/ps3keys and put these in the root
of an USB disc. 
    
Information

SACD-Ripper supports the following output formats:
 - 2ch DSDIFF (DSD)
 - 2ch DSDIFF (DST) (if already DST encoded)
 - 2ch DSF (DSD)
 - mch DSDIFF (DSD) 
 - mch DSDIFF (DST)
 - mch DSF (DSD)
 - ISO (due to the 4GB FAT32 size limit on the PS3, files will be splitted when larger)

There seems to be an SACD BluRay read speed limit that sets the maximum read speed to 2.6MB/sec, 
yes I agree, this is slow! But DST decoding is even slower.. The PS3 GameOS has 6 SPUs available 
for user operations. SACD-Ripper uses 1 SPU for decryption and the other 5!! for DST decoding.
Although this process is quite optimal the current decoding speed has been measured to be 0.9MB/sec
for a 2 channel rip. So for 2ch DST tracks the write speed to disc will be around 2.3MB/sec, for a
multi-channel the write speed is a bit higher (2.4MB.sec) but decoding is even slower at 0.6MB/sec.
